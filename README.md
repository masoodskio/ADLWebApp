# ADLWebApp

This is my update to my demo Angualr Dashboard App. 
I switched to standalone components.

This will also have an Express backend API and authentication using Supertokens

This is part of the web app I'm prototyping for a client so there are some weird custom functionality. 

Ideally this is reusable.
